        <h2>Rules</h2> 
        <p>
            Tank Tactics is an implementation of the game "Tank Turn Tactics" from <a href="https://youtu.be/t9WMNuyjm4w">this GDC talk</a>. I made it as close as possible to the game described in the talk, so I recommend watching it and learning the rules
            that way. For the people who don't want to do that, I have this guide for them.
        </p>
        <div id="Goal">
            <h2 class="h">Goal of the game</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of the game is to be the last player standing. You achieve this by attacking others, forming alliances and
                outsmarting your opponents with superior group strategy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Stats">
            <h2 class="h">Stats</h2>
            <p>
                Each player has 3 stats. They are the following:
            </p>
            <h3 id="HP" class="h"><i class="heart-replace"></i> Health (HP)</h3>
            <p>
                Health (or HP) is the amount of health a player has left. Every player starts with 3 Health. You can <a href="#Attacking">attack</a> players to lower their HP. HP can not be healed. Once a player's HP drops to 0, they join <a href="#Jury">the Jury</a> and are no longer able to interact with other players.
            </p>
            <h3 id="AP" class="h"><i class="bolt-replace"></i> Action Points (AP)</h3>
            <p>
                Action points (or AP) are used to <a href="#Actions">do everything in this game</a>. Every player starts with one. You can give AP to other players. Once every in-game day, every alive player gets one more AP. You can also obtain AP through
                <a href="#Jury">the Jury</a>.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Range" class="h"><i class="bullseye-replace"></i> Range</h3>
            <p>
                Range is the distance where you can't interact with players further than that distance. Every player's range starts at 2. Range can be <a href="#Upgrading_Range">upgraded</a>. You can see your range as the yellow squares around you.
                Your own range is highlighted in yellow, and if you select another player, their range is highlighted in dark red.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Actions">
            <h2 class="h">Actions</h2>
            <p>
                There are 4 actions that are able to do in the game, and they are the following:
            </p>
            <h3 id="Moving" class="h">üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Moving</h3>
            <p>
                Moving is changing your position. You are able to move one square in any direction (without the diagonals) per <a href="#AP">AP</a>.
                The squares that you can reach with your current amount of AP are highlighted in blue. You move by selecting an square and clicking üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Attacking" class="h">üî´ Attacking</h3>
            <p>
                Attacking is reducing another player's <a href="#HP">HP</a>. You can only attack in your <a href="#Range">range</a>. You remove one HP from your opponent per <a href="#AP">AP</a> used.
                You attack by selecting a player in your range and clicking üî´. If you double click it, it will automatically just deal 1 damage.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Giving_AP" class="h">‚úã Giving AP</h3>
            <p>
                You can give <a href="#AP">AP</a> to players in your range. You give 1 AP per AP.
                You give AP by selecting a player in your range and clicking ‚úã. If you double click it, it will automatically just give 1 AP.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Upgrading_Range" class="h">‚ú® Upgrading Your Range</h3>
            <p>
                You can upgrade your <a href="#Range">range</a>. You increase your range by 1 for every 2 <a href="#AP">AP</a> used.
                You upgrade your range by selecting yourself and clicking‚ú®. If you double click it, it will automatically just upgrade your range by 1.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Jury">
            <h2 class="h">The Jury</h2>
            <p>
                When a player dies, they join the jury. Everyone in the jury votes every 24 hours and when the vote ends, every player with 3+ votes gets one extra <a href="#AP">AP</a>. If you don't vote, your vote will be wasted.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Upgrading_Range" class="h">‚úÖ Voting</h3>
            <p>
                You vote by selecting a player and clicking the ‚úÖ icon. You can remove your vote by selecting the same player and clicking ‚ùé.
            </p>
